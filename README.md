Shiny WebApps for Econ 103 at UPenn
-----------------
This repository contains source code for various Shiny WebApps that I've written for use in my Introduction to Statistics for Economists Course (Econ 103) at UPenn. "Live" versions are hosted at ``shinyapps.io``. Simply append the desired directory name from this repository to ``fditraglia.shinyapps.io/``. For example, you can access the Normal CDF App at [https//fditraglia.shinyapps.io/normal_cdf/](https://fditraglia.shinyapps.io/normal_cdf).
